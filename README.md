This web application is connected to my Firebase realtime database. Once lauched, it will show a list of all newsfeed entries sorted by their publicaiton date in descending order. 
Below the list are two input fields where the user can post a newsfeed entry by specifying the content and the publication date. The user can also press the trash icon on the left side of each row to delete the corresponding newsfeed item.  


**Here is a screenshot of the application UI:**
